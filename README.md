# Technical Highlights of the Project

## 1. Frontend Frameworks and Libraries
- **Vue.js**: Based on repository information, the website primarily uses Vue.js as its frontend framework.
- **Vite**: Used as the development and build tool, offering fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build output.

## 2. HTTPS Secure Transmission and SSL Certificate Management
- **Automatic SSL Certificate**: Vercel automatically provides free SSL certificates for all custom domains, simplifying the HTTPS setup process.
- **Force HTTPS Redirect**: HTTP to HTTPS redirection can be easily configured using the `vercel.json` configuration file.

## 3. Frontend Performance Optimization and Resource Management
- **CDN Acceleration**: Vercel includes built-in global CDN, automatically distributing static resources to reduce loading time and improve user experience.
- **Caching Strategies**:
  - Use `Cache-Control` and `ETag` headers to control browser caching.
  - Utilize Vercel's edge network cache to further optimize static resource loading speed.
- **Lazy Image Loading**: Implements HTML5 `loading="lazy"` attribute to reduce initial screen load time.

## 4. Backend Architecture and Real-Time Communication
- **API Calls**: Although Vercel mainly serves frontend deployment, it can integrate API gateways or serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda or Vercel's own Serverless Functions) to handle dynamic data requests.
- **WebSocket Support**: For WebSocket support, additional services (such as Upstash Redis or third-party services) are usually required, as Vercel does not natively support WebSockets.

## 5. Development Debugging and Security Protection
- **Development Environment**: Uses Vite's development server for local development, enabling rapid iteration and testing of new features.
- **Security Enhancements**: Leverages Vercel's built-in security features (such as automatic HTTPS and DDoS protection), along with input validation and token verification mechanisms within the frontend code to ensure application security.

## 6. Server Operations and Monitoring
- **Vercel Dashboard**: Provides detailed deployment logs, performance metrics, and error tracking to help developers monitor the application status.
- **Seamless Scaling**: Thanks to Vercel's serverless architecture, the application can automatically scale based on traffic without manual intervention.
